My work is an exploration of the space between art and technical implementation.  
Systems and details are important parts of my creative process.  
I bring together specific knowledge, techniques and workflows from a broad range of domains as part of my problem solving process, striving to create robust design solutions which are as maintainable as they are efficient.
