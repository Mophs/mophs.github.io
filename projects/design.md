### Deathmasks — Explorations in Gravegoods

![FDM Faces as bowl](/media/images/design/deathmasks/design_industrial_deathmasks_exploration%20(1).jpeg)

{% include gallery.html folder="design/deathmasks/grid" %}

Laser scan self portraiture and artifact exploration. From a project around organic 3D printed death masks which would simultaneously decay alongside the real body whilst also blooming as seeds germinated in the substrate.

### Rings — Multi Material Property Exploration

{% include gallery.html folder="design/rings" %}

Printed on the Stratasys J750 poly-jet machine with components in different materials such as Veroflex.
Polyjet materials allow for not only color but hardness/opacity variation in a single print.

### Unfurl Lamp Prototype

{% include gallery.html folder="design/lamps/bend" %}

An articulated arm holds the light source, the brightness of the lamp is modulated by proximity to the reflector and casts a soft light down.

### Multi-Material Property 3D Printing

![Multimaterial face scan](/media/images/design/multimat/design_industrial_multimaterial_facescan.jpeg){:.centre-image}

Printed experiments with the Stratasys J750 polyjet printer.  
An Artec 3D scanner was used to capture a face model and a swatch was extracted to print in color.

### 3D Printed Stereo Adapter for Zoom Recorder

![3D printed mount](/media/images/design/jigs/design_industrial_stereo_mic_jig.jpeg){:.centre-image}

We needed a way to hold two XLR microphones in a stereo arrangement. I 3D printed a clamp and an arca-swiss-compatible tripod mounting plate. Simple hardware was used to for fixing the pieces in place

{% include gallery.html folder="design/misc/box" %}

3 Faces modulate in sound and light based on environmental brightness and sound. By covering the leftmost figures eye or turning the sensitivity dial on the right figures head and speaking, the sculpture reacts. Changing colors, shifting pitches and moving across frequencies.

### Graphic Design

### 3D Printed Parabolic Microphone

![Parabolic mic in Fusion 360, render from the front](/media/images/design/parabolic/parabolic_sidebyside.png)

Collaboration project to 3D print a parabolic microphone for bird recording.
Designed to accomodate most microphones with a clamp system and be carried alongside a handheld recording device.
