### Deathmasks — Explorations in Gravegoods

![FDM Faces as bowl](/media/images/design/deathmasks/design_industrial_deathmasks_exploration%20(1).jpeg)

{% include gallery.html folder="design/deathmasks/grid" %}

Laser scan self portraiture and artifact exploration. From a project around organic 3D printed death masks which would simultaneously decay alongside the real body whilst also blooming as seeds germinated in the substrate.

### Rings — Multi Material Property Exploration

{% include gallery.html folder="design/rings" %}

Printed on the Stratasys J750 poly-jet machine with components in different materials such as Veroflex.
Polyjet materials allow for not only color but hardness/opacity variation in a single print.

## Unfurl Lamp Prototype

{% include gallery.html folder="design/lamps/bend" %}

An articulated arm holds the light source, the brightness of the lamp is modulated by proximity to the reflector and casts a soft light down.

{% include gallery.html folder="design/misc/box" %}

3 Faces modulate in sound and light based on environmental brightness and sound. By covering the leftmost figures eye or turning the sensitivity dial on the right figures head and speaking, the sculpture reacts. Changing colors, shifting pitches and moving across frequencies.

### Graphic Design

{% include gallery.html folder="design/graphic" %}

Prototype multi-fold zine with characters who match in conversation depending on the fold direction.

Alamein EP art for the band Sol Fide

<!-- ### 3D Printed Parabolic Microphone

Collaboration project to 3D print a parabolic microphone for bird recording.
Designed to accomodate most microphones with a clamp system and be carried alongside a handheld recording device.
